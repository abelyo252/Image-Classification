# Image-Classification

This Colab notebook showcases an image classification model trained to classify images into different categories. The model has been trained on a dataset comprising images from various classes, including anacephaly, congi, down_syndrome, encephalocele, and placenta.

 This project aims to showcase the process of building an image classification model and provide a starting point for further exploration and experimentation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/abelyo252/Image-Classification.git

    Navigate to the project directory:
    shell

cd image-classification

Install the required dependencies:
shell

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Prepare your dataset:
        Organize your images into separate directories for each class.
        use this notebook to train based on your custom data, but make 
        sure change hyper-parameter of this model

    Train the model:
    shell


Inference:
python

    import tensorflow as tf
    import numpy as np
    import cv2

    # Load the trained model
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('load_your_model.h5')

    # Load and preprocess the input image
    image = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img('path/to/image.jpg', target_size=(224, 224))
    image = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(image)
    image = image / 255.0

    # Perform inference
    image = cv2.resize(image, (256, 256))
    img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    # Preprocess the image
    input_image = np.expand_dims(img_rgb, axis=0)  # Add a batch dimension
    input_image = input_image / 255.0  # Normalize the image
    
    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(input_image)
    # Get the predicted class labels
    predicted_labels = tf.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
    
    # Map the predicted labels to class names
    predicted_class_names = [class_names[label] for label in predicted_labels]
    # Print the predicted class names
    print("Predicted Class Names:", predicted_class_names)


    Replace 'path/to/image.jpg' with the path to your input image.
